Welcome to **our first website**!

In this post, we'll share why we chose Hugo and the Hugo Profile theme for our new site and how you can create new posts easily using Markdown. Here are some points:

- **Fast & flexible**: Hugo is a static site generator that builds sites quickly.
- **Hugo Profile theme**: Professional profile-focused design with sections for experience, projects, and more.
- **Markdown content**: Write posts in Markdown, commit them to the `content/posts` folder, and they'll be automatically published.

To create new posts, simply add a new `.md` file in `content/posts/` with front matter like above. We'll cover more features in future posts!
